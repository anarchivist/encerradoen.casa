Lots of us have been struggling for a few weeks about how to prepare for the psychological impact of being stuck at home to [flatten the curve](https://www.flattenthecurve.com/). Rather than just work too much, some of us have found it useful to turn to our creative endeavors as a place to find some comfort or stability.

In February, while taking a few days off from work, I read about [musicians in China livestreaming during social distancing](https://radiichina.com/amidst-coronavirus-lockdown-musicians-in-china-livestream-the-party/). I was particularly interested in about [the rehearsal series](https://cdm.link/2020/02/coronavirus-online-music-streaming/) organized by Zhu Wenbo and Zhao Cong of [Zoomin' Night](https://zoominnight.bandcamp.com/), and how we might try to organize something similar in our timezones.

**encerrado en casa** is an attempt at organizing live experimental music and video art in the age of social distancing. It's an opportunity to try both new and old technologies, in varying ways: small, intimate gatherings of friends, to perhaps something livelier with lots more attendees we don't know. Start  small by picking a date and a time, with a goal or sequence.
