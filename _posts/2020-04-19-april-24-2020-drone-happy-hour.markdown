Join us on Friday, April 24, at 4:00 PM Pacific/7:00 PM Eastern/23:00 GMT. We'll be streaming some live ambient, drone, and electroacoustic music. Make yourself a soothing beverage of any variety, fix yourself a light snack, and settle into your weekend.

Please feel free to connect your gear and join the clamor. You'll be muted on on entry, but feel free to unmute. **This will be recorded**
