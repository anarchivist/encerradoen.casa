**encerrado en casa** is an attempt at organizing live experimental music and video art in the age of social distancing. It's an opportunity to try both new and old technologies, in varying ways: small, intimate gatherings of friends, joining in a shared rehearsal and performance. We encourage you to start small by picking a date, a time, and a platform. Contact us if you'd like to perform.
