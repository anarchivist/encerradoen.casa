**encerrado en casa** is an attempt at organizing live experimental music and video art in the age of social distancing. It's an opportunity to try both new and old technologies, in varying ways: small, intimate gatherings of friends, to perhaps something livelier with lots more attendees we don't know. Start  small by picking a date and a time, with a goal or sequence.
